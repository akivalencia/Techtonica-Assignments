                <h1>Ratatouille</h1>

                <p>I was initially inspired to try this dish thanks to the Pixar movie making it look so pretty. My oh my, though, this dish actually tastes delicious! It's filling, cheap, vegetarian, and nutritious. Wins all around!</p></header>

                        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced (Really, however much garlic you like. We know how it is.)</li>
                        <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced into semi circles</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 190C/375F.</li>
                        <li>Sautee onion, garlic,  and black pepper in olive oil until onions start to turn translucent. </li>
                        <li>Add pasta sauce to mix, let cook 5 - 10 minutes on medium heat, stirring regularly.</li>
                        <li>[OPTIONAL] At this point, you can add cinammon, red pepper flakes and/or oregano to your sauce.</li>
                        <li>Coat the bottom of your skillet or casserole dish in your sauce mixture. I recommend about 2cm or "one knuckle" deep.</li>
                        <li>Lay out your thinly sliced vegetables in alternating patterns until the whole bottom is covered.. Really, whatever looks good to you, this part is fun. </li>
                        <li>Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                        <li>Mix 3 tbsp. of olive oil with thyme, basil, and minced garlic together and drizzle, brush, or otherwise spread this mixture on top of the vegetables.</li>
                        <li>[OPTIONAL] Sprinkle grated parmesan on top to your liking.</li>
                        <li>Cover with foil.</li>
                        <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes until sauce is bubbly and vegetables are soft.</li>
                        <li>Garnish with basil, to make it extra pretty.</li>
